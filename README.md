For the hilo game

Title: HI-LO

# Description: 
Are you feeling lucky? Play HI-LO to test your prediction skills,
be careful, you are always at the mercy of the cards! A card is 
played between 1 and 14, and then you decide if the next random
card will be higher or lower. It's easy! You start with 300 points,
and everytime you win you are given 100 points. But be careful, if 
you guess incorrectly you lose 75. The game ends when you either hit
0 points or quit.

# Project Structure: 
There are 4 python files in this folder. __main__, card, hilogame, and player.
Card and player both contain stand alone classes that can be imported. Player 
allows you to make a new player and keep track of their points, while card
generates a new randomized card. Director directs the game and calls player and
card in order to make things happen. Main imports Director and contains an 
instance of it to start the game.
